use the master slave paradigm

master creates jobs
dispatches them if there are slaves waiting
otherwise throws the job onto a queue

DEFINE N 8

master:
	queue job_pool //create a job pool queue
	
	/*
	* create a queue of workers with everyone except the
	* master waiting in line
	*/
	queue workers
	for i in 1 to p-1
		enque i
		
	for i in 1 to k
		int board_layout = 0;
		for j in 1 to N
			board_layout += j * 10^((N - 1)-i)
	





slave:


boolean is_valid(int board_layout);
